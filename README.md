Javascripts´ skills that were put in practice: functions, arrays in arrays and objects, usage of different files in one same proyect, time "shedule" functions and use of local storage. No empty answers are allow.
For this proyect I base on two different sources first one , James Q Quick developer link: https://github.com/jamesqquick/Build-A-Quiz-App-With-HTML-CSS-and-JavaScript.git. 
 Second , Tecnológico de Monterrey bootcamp´s solution, as I couldn´t manage the Highscore function until I separate files and worke independently.
